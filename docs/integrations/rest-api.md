# REST API Overview

## What is a REST API?

REST stands for [representational state transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST). It's a particular type of API which employs HTTP requests and [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)](https://www.json.org/) to facilitate create, retrieve, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on objects within an application. Each type of operation is associated with a particular HTTP verb:

* `GET`: Retrieve an object or list of objects
* `POST`: Create an object
* `PUT` / `PATCH`: Modify an existing object. `PUT` requires all mandatory fields to be specified, while `PATCH` only expects the field that is being modified to be specified.
* `DELETE`: Delete an existing object

Additionally, the `OPTIONS` verb can be used to inspect a particular REST API endpoint and return all supported actions and their available parameters.

One of the primary benefits of a REST API is its human-friendliness. Because it utilizes HTTP and JSON, it's very easy to interact with NetBox data on the command line using common tools. For example, we can request an IP address from NetBox and output the JSON using `curl` and `jq`. The following command makes an HTTP `GET` request for information about a particular IP address, identified by its primary key, and uses `jq` to present the raw JSON data returned in a more human-friendly format. (Piping the output through `jq` isn't strictly required but makes it much easier to read.)

```no-highlight
curl -s http://netbox/api/ipam/ip-addresses/2954/ | jq '.'
```

```json
{
  "id": 2954,
  "url": "http://netbox/api/ipam/ip-addresses/2954/",
  "family": {
    "value": 4,
    "label": "IPv4"
  },
  "address": "192.168.0.42/26",
  "vrf": null,
  "tenant": null,
  "status": {
    "value": "active",
    "label": "Active"
  },
  "role": null,
  "assigned_object_type": "dcim.interface",
  "assigned_object_id": 114771,
  "assigned_object": {
    "id": 114771,
    "url": "http://netbox/api/dcim/interfaces/114771/",
    "device": {
      "id": 2230,
      "url": "http://netbox/api/dcim/devices/2230/",
      "name": "router1",
      "display_name": "router1"
    },
    "name": "et-0/1/2",
    "cable": null,
    "connection_status": null
  },
  "nat_inside": null,
  "nat_outside": null,
  "dns_name": "",
  "description": "Example IP address",
  "tags": [],
  "custom_fields": {},
  "created": "2020-08-04",
  "last_updated": "2020-08-04T14:12:39.666885Z"
}
```

Each attribute of the IP address is expressed as an attribute of the JSON object. Fields may include their own nested objects, as in the case of the `assigned_object` field above. Every object includes a primary key named `id` which uniquely identifies it in the database.

## Interactive Documentation

Comprehensive, interactive documentation of all REST API endpoints is available on a running NetBox instance at `/api/schema/swagger-ui/`. This interface provides a convenient sandbox for researching and experimenting with specific endpoints and request types. The API itself can also be explored using a web browser by navigating to its root at `/api/`.

## Endpoint Hierarchy

NetBox's entire REST API is housed under the API root at `https://<hostname>/api/`. The URL structure is divided at the root level by application: circuits, DCIM, extras, IPAM, plugins, tenancy, users, and virtualization. Within each application exists a separate path for each model. For example, the provider and circuit objects are located under the "circuits" application:

* `/api/circuits/providers/`
* `/api/circuits/circuits/`

Likewise, the site, rack, and device objects are located under the "DCIM" application:

* `/api/dcim/sites/`
* `/api/dcim/racks/`
* `/api/dcim/devices/`

The full hierarchy of available endpoints can be viewed by navigating to the API root in a web browser.

Each model generally has two views associated with it: a list view and a detail view. The list view is used to retrieve a list of multiple objects and to create new objects. The detail view is used to retrieve, update, or delete a single existing object. All objects are referenced by their numeric primary key (`id`).

* `/api/dcim/devices/` - List existing devices or create a new device
* `/api/dcim/devices/123/` - Retrieve, update, or delete the device with ID 123

Lists of objects can be filtered and ordered using a set of query parameters. For example, to find all interfaces belonging to the device with ID 123:

```
GET /api/dcim/interfaces/?device_id=123
```

An optional `ordering` parameter can be used to define how to sort the results. Building off the previous example, to sort all the interfaces in reverse order of creation (newest to oldest) for a device with ID 123:

```
GET /api/dcim/interfaces/?device_id=123&ordering=-created
```

See the [filtering documentation](../reference/filtering.md) for more details on topics related to filtering, ordering and lookup expressions.

## Serialization

The REST API generally represents objects in one of two ways: complete or brief. The base serializer is used to present the complete view of an object. This includes all database table fields which comprise the model, and may include additional metadata. A base serializer includes relationships to parent objects, but **does not** include child objects. For example, the `VLANSerializer` includes a nested representation its parent VLANGroup (if any), but does not include any assigned Prefixes. Serializers employ a minimal "brief" representation of related objects, which includes only the attributes prudent for identifying the object.

```json
{
    "id": 1048,
    "site": {
        "id": 7,
        "url": "http://netbox/api/dcim/sites/7/",
        "name": "Corporate HQ",
        "slug": "corporate-hq"
    },
    "group": {
        "id": 4,
        "url": "http://netbox/api/ipam/vlan-groups/4/",
        "name": "Production",
        "slug": "production"
    },
    "vid": 101,
    "name": "Users-Floor1",
    "tenant": null,
    "status": {
        "value": 1,
        "label": "Active"
    },
    "role": {
        "id": 9,
        "url": "http://netbox/api/ipam/roles/9/",
        "name": "User Access",
        "slug": "user-access"
    },
    "description": "",
    "display_name": "101 (Users-Floor1)",
    "custom_fields": {}
}
```

### Related Objects

Related objects (e.g. `ForeignKey` fields) are included using nested brief representations. This is a minimal representation of an object, including only its direct URL and enough information to display the object to a user. When performing write API actions (`POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH`), related objects may be specified by either numeric ID (primary key), or by a set of attributes sufficiently unique to return the desired object.

For example, when creating a new device, its rack can be specified by NetBox ID (PK):

```json
{
    "name": "MyNewDevice",
    "rack": 123,
    ...
}
```

Or by a set of attributes which uniquely identify the rack:

```json
{
    "name": "MyNewDevice",
    "rack": {
        "site": {
            "name": "Equinix DC6"
        },
        "name": "R204"
    },
    ...
}
```

Note that if the provided parameters do not return exactly one object, a validation error is raised.

!!! note "Permissions"
    When a related object is referenced by a set of attributes, the lookup is restricted to only those objects which the requesting user has permission to view. This prevents the enumeration of objects by their attributes. Referencing a related object directly by its numeric ID is always permitted, regardless of the user's view permissions for that object.

### Generic Relations

Some objects within NetBox have attributes which can reference an object of multiple types, known as _generic relations_. For example, an IP address can be assigned to either a device interface _or_ a virtual machine interface. When making this assignment via the REST API, we must specify two attributes:

* `assigned_object_type` - The content type of the assigned object, defined as `<app>.<model>`
* `assigned_object_id` - The assigned object's unique numeric ID

Together, these values identify a unique object in NetBox. The assigned object (if any) is represented by the `assigned_object` attribute on the IP address model.

```no-highlight
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json; indent=4" \
http://netbox/api/ipam/ip-addresses/ \
--data '{
    "address": "192.0.2.1/24",
    "assigned_object_type": "dcim.interface",
    "assigned_object_id": 69023
}'
```

```json
{
    "id": 56296,
    "url": "http://netbox/api/ipam/ip-addresses/56296/",
    "assigned_object_type": "dcim.interface",
    "assigned_object_id": 69000,
    "assigned_object": {
        "id": 69000,
        "url": "http://netbox/api/dcim/interfaces/69023/",
        "device": {
            "id": 2174,
            "url": "http://netbox/api/dcim/devices/2174/",
            "name": "device105",
            "display_name": "device105"
        },
        "name": "ge-0/0/0",
        "cable": null,
        "connection_status": null
    },
    ...
}
```

If we wanted to assign this IP address to a virtual machine interface instead, we would have set `assigned_object_type` to `virtualization.vminterface` and updated the object ID appropriately.

### Specifying Fields

A REST API response will include all available fields for the object type by default. If you wish to return only a subset of the available fields, you can append `?fields=` to the URL followed by a comma-separated list of field names. For example, the following request will return only the `id`, `name`, `status`, and `region` fields for each site in the response.

```
GET /api/dcim/sites/?fields=id,name,status,region
```

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "DM-NYC",
    "status": {
        "value": "active",
        "label": "Active"
    },
    "region": {
        "id": 43,
        "url": "http://netbox:8000/api/dcim/regions/43/",
        "display": "New York",
        "name": "New York",
        "slug": "us-ny",
        "description": "",
        "site_count": 0,
        "_depth": 2
    }
}
```

Similarly, you can opt to omit only specific fields by passing the `omit` parameter:

```
GET /api/dcim/sites/?omit=circuit_count,device_count,virtualmachine_count
```

Strategic use of the `fields` and `omit` parameters can drastically improve REST API performance, as the exclusion of fields which reference related objects reduces the number and complexity of underlying database queries needed to generate the response.

!!! note
    The `fields` and `omit` parameters should be considered mutually exclusive. If both are passed, `fields` takes precedence.

#### Brief Format

Most API endpoints support an optional "brief" format, which returns only a minimal representation of each object in the response. This is useful when you need only a list of available objects without any related data, such as when populating a drop-down list in a form. It's also more convenient than listing out individual fields via the `fields` or `omit` parameters. As an example, the default (complete) format of a prefix looks like this:

```no-highlight
GET /api/ipam/prefixes/13980/
```

```json
{
    "id": 13980,
    "url": "http://netbox/api/ipam/prefixes/13980/",
    "display_url": "http://netbox/api/ipam/prefixes/13980/",
    "display": "192.0.2.0/24",
    "family": {
        "value": 4,
        "label": "IPv4"
    },
    "prefix": "192.0.2.0/24",
    "vrf": null,
    "scope_type": "dcim.site",
    "scope_id": 3,
    "scope": {
        "id": 3,
        "url": "http://netbox/api/dcim/sites/3/",
        "display": "Site 23A",
        "name": "Site 23A",
        "slug": "site-23a",
        "description": ""
    },
    "tenant": null,
    "vlan": null,
    "status": {
        "value": "container",
        "label": "Container"
    },
    "role": {
        "id": 17,
        "url": "http://netbox/api/ipam/roles/17/",
        "name": "Staging",
        "slug": "staging"
    },
    "is_pool": false,
    "mark_utilized": false,
    "description": "Example prefix",
    "comments": "",
    "tags": [],
    "custom_fields": {},
    "created": "2025-03-01T20:01:23.458302Z",
    "last_updated": "2025-03-01T20:02:46.173540Z",
    "children": 0,
    "_depth": 0
}
```

The brief format includes only a few fields:

```no-highlight
GET /api/ipam/prefixes/13980/?brief=true
```

```json
{
    "id": 13980,
    "url": "http://netbox/api/ipam/prefixes/13980/",
    "display": "192.0.2.0/24",
    "family": {
        "value": 4,
        "label": "IPv4"
    },
    "prefix": "192.0.2.0/24",
    "description": "Example prefix",
    "_depth": 0
}
```

The brief format is supported for both lists and individual objects.

## Pagination

API responses which contain a list of many objects will be paginated for efficiency. NetBox employs offset-based pagination by default, which forms a page by skipping the number of objects indicated by the `offset` URL parameter. The root JSON object returned by a list endpoint contains the following attributes:

* `count`: The total number of all objects matching the query
* `next`: A hyperlink to the next page of results (if applicable)
* `previous`: A hyperlink to the previous page of results (if applicable)
* `results`: The list of objects on the current page

Here is an example of a paginated response:

```
HTTP 200 OK
Allow: GET, POST, OPTIONS
Content-Type: application/json
Vary: Accept

{
    "count": 2861,
    "next": "http://netbox/api/dcim/devices/?limit=50&offset=50",
    "previous": null,
    "results": [
        {
            "id": 231,
            "name": "Device1",
            ...
        },
        {
            "id": 232,
            "name": "Device2",
            ...
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

The default page is determined by the [`PAGINATE_COUNT`](../configuration/default-values.md#paginate_count) configuration parameter, which defaults to 50. However, this can be overridden per request by specifying the desired `offset` and `limit` query parameters. For example, if you wish to retrieve a hundred devices at a time, you would make a request for:

```
http://netbox/api/dcim/devices/?limit=100
```

The response will return devices 1 through 100. The URL provided in the `next` attribute of the response will return devices 101 through 200:

```json
{
    "count": 2861,
    "next": "http://netbox/api/dcim/devices/?limit=100&offset=100",
    "previous": null,
    "results": [...]
}
```

The maximum number of objects that can be returned is limited by the [`MAX_PAGE_SIZE`](../configuration/miscellaneous.md#max_page_size) configuration parameter, which is 1000 by default. Setting this to `0` or `None` will remove the maximum limit. An API consumer can then pass `?limit=0` to retrieve _all_ matching objects with a single request.

!!! warning
    Disabling the page size limit introduces a potential for very resource-intensive requests, since one API request can effectively retrieve an entire table from the database.

### Cursor-Based Pagination

For large datasets, offset-based pagination can become inefficient because the database must scan all rows up to the offset. As an alternative, cursor-based pagination uses the `start` query parameter to filter results by primary key (PK), enabling efficient keyset pagination.

To use cursor-based pagination, pass `start` (the minimum PK value) and `limit` (the page size):

```
http://netbox/api/dcim/devices/?start=0&limit=100
```

This returns objects with an `id` greater than or equal to zero, ordered by PK, limited to 100 results. Below is an example showing an arbitrary `start` value.

```json
{
    "count": null,
    "next": "http://netbox/api/dcim/devices/?start=356&limit=100",
    "previous": null,
    "results": [
        {
            "id": 109,
            "name": "dist-router07",
            ...
        },
        ...
        {
            "id": 356,
            "name": "acc-switch492",
            ...
        }
    ]
}
```

To iterate through all results, use the `id` of the last object in each response plus one as the `start` value for the next request. Continue until `next` is null.

!!! info
    Some important differences from offset-based pagination:

    * `start` and `offset` are **mutually exclusive**; specifying both will result in a 400 error.
    * Results are always ordered by primary key when using `start`. This is required to ensure deterministic behavior.
    * `count` is always `null` in cursor mode, as counting all matching rows would partially negate its performance benefit.
    * `previous` is always `null`: cursor-based pagination supports only forward navigation.

## Interacting with Objects

### Retrieving Multiple Objects

To query NetBox for a list of objects, make a `GET` request to the model's _list_ endpoint. Objects are listed under the response object's `results` parameter.

```no-highlight
curl -s -X GET http://netbox/api/ipam/ip-addresses/ | jq '.'
```

```json
{
  "count": 42031,
  "next": "http://netbox/api/ipam/ip-addresses/?limit=50&offset=50",
  "previous": null,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 5618,
      "address": "192.0.2.1/24",
      ...
    },
    {
      "id": 5619,
      "address": "192.0.2.2/24",
      ...
    },
    {
      "id": 5620,
      "address": "192.0.2.3/24",
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Retrieving a Single Object

To query NetBox for a single object, make a `GET` request to the model's _detail_ endpoint specifying its unique numeric ID.

!!! note
    Note that the trailing slash is required. Omitting this will return a 302 redirect.

```no-highlight
curl -s -X GET http://netbox/api/ipam/ip-addresses/5618/ | jq '.'
```

```json
{
  "id": 5618,
  "address": "192.0.2.1/24",
  ...
}
```

### Creating a New Object

To create a new object, make a `POST` request to the model's _list_ endpoint with JSON data pertaining to the object being created. Note that a REST API token is required for all write operations; see the [authentication section](#authenticating-to-the-api) for more information. Also be sure to set the `Content-Type` HTTP header to `application/json`.

```no-highlight
curl -s -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
http://netbox/api/ipam/prefixes/ \
--data '{"prefix": "192.0.2.0/24", "scope_type": "dcim.site", "scope_id": 6}' | jq '.'
```

```json
{
  "id": 18691,
  "url": "http://netbox/api/ipam/prefixes/18691/",
  "display_url": "http://netbox/api/ipam/prefixes/18691/",
  "display": "192.0.2.0/24",
  "family": {
    "value": 4,
    "label": "IPv4"
  },
  "prefix": "192.0.2.0/24",
  "vrf": null,
  "scope_type": "dcim.site",
  "scope_id": 6,
  "scope": {
    "id": 6,
    "url": "http://netbox/api/dcim/sites/6/",
    "display": "US-East 4",
    "name": "US-East 4",
    "slug": "us-east-4",
    "description": ""
  },
  "tenant": null,
  "vlan": null,
  "status": {
    "value": "active",
    "label": "Active"
  },
  "role": null,
  "is_pool": false,
  "mark_utilized": false,
  "description": "",
  "comments": "",
  "tags": [],
  "custom_fields": {},
  "created": "2025-04-29T15:44:47.597092Z",
  "last_updated": "2025-04-29T15:44:47.597092Z",
  "children": 0,
  "_depth": 0
}
```

### Creating Multiple Objects

To create multiple instances of a model using a single request, make a `POST` request to the model's _list_ endpoint with a list of JSON objects representing each instance to be created. If successful, the response will contain a list of the newly created instances. The example below illustrates the creation of three new sites.

```no-highlight
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json; indent=4" \
http://netbox/api/dcim/sites/ \
--data '[
{"name": "Site 1", "slug": "site-1", "region": {"name": "United States"}},
{"name": "Site 2", "slug": "site-2", "region": {"name": "United States"}},
{"name": "Site 3", "slug": "site-3", "region": {"name": "United States"}}
]'
```

```json
[
    {
        "id": 21,
        "url": "http://netbox/api/dcim/sites/21/",
        "name": "Site 1",
        ...
    },
    {
        "id": 22,
        "url": "http://netbox/api/dcim/sites/22/",
        "name": "Site 2",
        ...
    },
    {
        "id": 23,
        "url": "http://netbox/api/dcim/sites/23/",
        "name": "Site 3",
        ...
    }
]
```

!!! note
    The bulk creation of objects is an all-or-none operation, meaning that if NetBox fails to successfully create any of the specified objects (e.g. due to a validation error), the entire operation will be aborted and none of the objects will be created.

### Updating an Object

To modify an object which has already been created, make a `PATCH` request to the model's _detail_ endpoint specifying its unique numeric ID. Include any data which you wish to update on the object. As with object creation, the `Authorization` and `Content-Type` headers must also be specified.

```no-highlight
curl -s -X PATCH \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
http://netbox/api/ipam/prefixes/18691/ \
--data '{"status": "reserved"}' | jq '.'
```

```json
{
  "id": 18691,
  "url": "http://netbox/api/ipam/prefixes/18691/",
  "display_url": "http://netbox/api/ipam/prefixes/18691/",
  "display": "192.0.2.0/24",
  "family": {
    "value": 4,
    "label": "IPv4"
  },
  "prefix": "192.0.2.0/24",
  "vrf": null,
  "scope_type": "dcim.site",
  "scope_id": 6,
  "scope": {
    "id": 6,
    "url": "http://netbox/api/dcim/sites/6/",
    "display": "US-East 4",
    "name": "US-East 4",
    "slug": "us-east-4",
    "description": ""
  },
  "tenant": null,
  "vlan": null,

!!! note "PUT versus PATCH"
    The NetBox REST API support the use of either `PUT` or `PATCH` to modify an existing object. The difference is that a `PUT` request requires the user to specify a _complete_ representation of the object being modified, whereas a `PATCH` request need include only the attributes that are being updated. For most purposes, using `PATCH` is recommended.

### Updating Multiple Objects

Multiple objects can be updated simultaneously by issuing a `PUT` or `PATCH` request to a model's list endpoint with a list of dictionaries specifying the numeric ID of each object to be deleted and the attributes to be updated. For example, to update sites with IDs 10 and 11 to a status of "active", issue the following request:

```no-highlight
curl -s -X PATCH \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
http://netbox/api/dcim/sites/ \
--data '[{"id": 10, "status": "active"}, {"id": 11, "status": "active"}]'
```

Note that there is no requirement for the attributes to be identical among objects. For instance, it's possible to update the status of one site along with the name of another in the same request.

!!! note
    The bulk update of objects is an all-or-none operation, meaning that if NetBox fails to successfully update any of the specified objects (e.g. due a validation error), the entire operation will be aborted and none of the objects will be updated.

### Errors in Bulk Operations

!!! info "This feature was introduced in NetBox v4.7."

When a bulk creation or update fails validation, the response identifies each offending object by its index within the submitted list, so that a client can correct and resubmit only the objects which actually failed. (The operation itself remains all-or-none: No objects are written unless every object validates.)

```json
{
    "detail": "1 of 3 objects failed validation.",
    "errors": [
        {
            "index": 1,
            "errors": {
                "slug": ["This field may not be blank."]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Concurrent Update Protection

To guard against the lost-update problem when multiple clients modify the same object, NetBox returns a weak `ETag` response header on detail-view responses (`GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `PUT`) for individual objects. Clients may supply this value back on a subsequent `PATCH` or `PUT` request via the `If-Match` request header. If the object's current ETag does not match any of the values supplied, the server rejects the request with a `412 Precondition Failed` response and includes the current ETag in the response so the client can retry.

```no-highlight
# Capture the ETag returned with the object
$ curl -s -i -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://netbox/api/dcim/sites/1/ | grep -i ^etag
ETag: W/"2026-05-01T17:42:11.123456+00:00"

# Submit an update with If-Match referencing that ETag
$ curl -s -X PATCH \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H 'If-Match: W/"2026-05-01T17:42:11.123456+00:00"' \
    http://netbox/api/dcim/sites/1/ \
    --data '{"status": "decommissioning"}'
```

A literal `If-Match: *` value matches any current ETag and may be used to assert simply that the object exists. Submitting `If-Match` is optional; requests without the header retain prior (last-write-wins) behavior.

### Adding and Removing Tags

In addition to replacing an object's tag set wholesale via the `tags` field, taggable models accept two write-only fields, `add_tags` and `remove_tags`, which apply only the specified additions or removals without disturbing existing tags. This is convenient when concurrent clients each manage a distinct subset of an object's tags.

```no-highlight
curl -s -X PATCH \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
http://netbox/api/dcim/sites/1/ \
--data '{
    "add_tags": [{"name": "production"}],
    "remove_tags": [{"name": "staging"}]
}'
```

Constraints:

* `tags` may not be combined with `add_tags` or `remove_tags` in the same request.
* `remove_tags` is only valid on updates; it cannot be used when creating a new object.
* The same tag may not appear in both `add_tags` and `remove_tags`.

### Deleting an Object

To delete an object from NetBox, make a `DELETE` request to the model's _detail_ endpoint specifying its unique numeric ID. The `Authorization` header must be included to specify an authorization token, however this type of request does not support passing any data in the body.

```no-highlight
curl -s -X DELETE \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
http://netbox/api/ipam/prefixes/18691/
```

Note that `DELETE` requests do not return any data: If successful, the API will return a 204 (No Content) response.

!!! note
    You can run `curl` with the verbose (`-v`) flag to inspect the HTTP response codes.

### Deleting Multiple Objects

NetBox supports the simultaneous deletion of multiple objects of the same type by issuing a `DELETE` request to the model's list endpoint with a list of dictionaries specifying the numeric ID of each object to be deleted. For example, to delete sites with IDs 10, 11, and 12, issue the following request:

```no-highlight
curl -s -X DELETE \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
http://netbox/api/dcim/sites/ \
--data '[{"id": 10}, {"id": 11}, {"id": 12}]'
```

!!! note
    The bulk deletion of objects is an all-or-none operation, meaning that if NetBox fails to delete any of the specified objects (e.g. due a dependency by a related object), the entire operation will be aborted and none of the objects will be deleted.

## Background Processing

!!! info "This feature was introduced in NetBox v4.7."

Bulk write operations (creating, updating, or deleting multiple objects via a model's list endpoint) can optionally be processed as a [background job](../features/background-jobs.md) rather than synchronously. This is useful for large batches that would otherwise hold the connection open long enough to risk a proxy or gateway timeout.

To request background processing, append the `background=true` query parameter to a bulk write request. NetBox enqueues a job and returns an `HTTP 202 Accepted` response containing the job's ID and URL. The actual write is performed later by a worker, running the same logic (and preserving the same all-or-none transaction semantics) as the synchronous path. Note that the request payload is **not** validated before the job is enqueued; validation is deferred to the worker (see below).

```no-highlight
curl -s -X PATCH \
-H "Authorization: Token $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
http://netbox/api/dcim/sites/?background=true \
--data '[{"id": 10, "status": "active"}, {"id": 11, "status": "active"}]'
```

The response identifies the enqueued job:

```json
{
    "job": {
        "id": 42,
        "url": "http://netbox/api/core/jobs/42/",
        "status": "pending"
    }
}
```

Poll the job's URL to track its progress. When the job reaches a terminal status, its `data` field holds the result and its `error` field describes any failure. The `data` field mirrors the response the synchronous request would have returned, as an object with the HTTP `status_code` and the response `data`. For example, a completed bulk update records:

```json
{
    "status_code": 200,
    "data": [
        {"id": 10, "url": "http://netbox/api/dcim/sites/10/", "status": {"value": "active"}, "...": "..."}
    ]
}
```

A failed job records the equivalent error response, for instance `{"status_code": 400, "data": {"slug": ["This field may not be blank."]}}`, with a short summary also placed in the job's `error` field.

A `202` response indicates that the request was accepted and queued, not that it succeeded: validation (including malformed or invalid payloads) and the database write all occur when the job runs. A rejected payload is therefore reported as a failed job rather than a synchronous error response. Always inspect the job's final status to confirm the outcome. Because the result is stored on the job, any user permitted to view jobs (`core.view_job`, subject to object permissions) can read the serialized objects it contains.

Background processing applies only to bulk operations (a JSON list) on a model's list endpoint. For a single-object write the `background` parameter is ignored and the request is processed synchronously. It cannot be combined with an [`If-Match`](#if-match) precondition (which cannot be evaluated reliably once execution is deferred); such a request is rejected with an `HTTP 400` response. If no background worker is running to service the queue, the request is rejected with an `HTTP 503` response rather than enqueuing a job that would never run.

Two behaviors differ from a synchronous request and may change in a future release: field selection via [`fields`/`omit`](#specifying-fields) (and brief mode) is not applied to the stored result, and the authorization captured when the request is accepted is not re-checked if the token is later disabled or expires before the job runs.

## Idempotent Writes

Network automation clients frequently need to retry a write request (POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE) after a proxy timeout or lost connection. Retrying blindly can duplicate the effect of the original request — for example, creating the same object twice, recording duplicate change log entries, or enqueuing the same background job more than once. Supply an `Idempotency-Key` request header to make such retries safe:

```no-highlight
curl -s -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Idempotency-Key: 7d139e0c-4f2b-4e90-9f8c-0a1b2c3d4e5f" \
http://netbox/api/dcim/sites/ \
--data '{"name": "Site A", "slug": "site-a"}'
```

The key identifies a single logical request within the scope of the authenticated user, the HTTP method, and the request path. The first request with a given key executes normally, and its final result — the HTTP status code, response body, and relevant headers (such as `Location` and `ETag`) — is stored alongside a semantic fingerprint of the request (its raw body and any query parameter that affects write semantics, such as `background`).

Behavior on subsequent requests carrying the same key:

- **Identical request (same body and write-significant parameters):** the stored response is replayed with the same status code and body, and the response includes an `Idempotency-Replayed: true` header. The write is not performed again: no additional database changes, change log entries, event rule triggers, or background jobs result. Response-shaping query parameters (`fields`, `omit`, `brief`, `format`) do not affect the fingerprint and may differ between attempts.
- **Different request body or write-significant parameters:** the request is rejected with `HTTP 409 Conflict` and is not executed. Use a fresh key for a different operation.
- **Concurrent requests:** only one request executes; concurrent requests carrying the same key wait for the first request to complete and then receive its stored result. If the wait exceeds the configured lock timeout, the request fails with `HTTP 409` and may be retried.
- **Server failures:** if the first request fails with a server-side error (5xx), nothing is stored and the key may be reused to retry the operation. Client errors (4xx) are stored and replayed like any other completed response.

The key must contain 1–255 printable characters. Requests without an `Idempotency-Key` header, as well as read-only requests (GET/HEAD/OPTIONS), behave exactly as before. Completed idempotency records are retained for the configured retention period (default 24 hours) and reclaimed by the daily system housekeeping job; see [`IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_RETENTION`](../configuration/miscellaneous.md#idempotency_key_retention).

!!! note
    The semantic fingerprint is based on the raw request body: a retry must send the same body byte-for-byte. Multipart/form-data requests that regenerate a random `boundary` between attempts will be treated as different requests and rejected with `409`; this does not affect JSON clients. A replay returns the original response as produced by the first request, including its content type and any `Location`/`ETag` headers, regardless of the retry request's `Accept` header.

## Changelog Messages

Most objects in NetBox support [change logging](../features/change-logging.md), which generates a detailed record each time an object is created, modified, or deleted. Additionally, users can attach a message to the change record as well. This is accomplished via the REST API by including a `changelog_message` field in the object representation.

For example, the following API request will create a new site and record a message in the resulting changelog entry:

```no-highlight
curl -s -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
http://netbox/api/dcim/sites/ \
--data '{
    "name": "Site A",
    "slug": "site-a",
    "changelog_message": "Adding a site for ticket #4137"
}'
```

This approach works when creating, modifying, or deleting objects, either individually or in bulk. For more information about change logging, see [Change Logging](../features/change-logging.md).

## Uploading Files

As JSON does not support the inclusion of binary data, files cannot be uploaded using JSON-formatted API requests. Instead, we can use form data encoding to attach a local file.

For example, we can upload an image attachment using the `curl` command shown below. Note that the `@` signifies a local file on disk to be uploaded.

```no-highlight
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-H "Accept: application/json; indent=4" \
-F "object_type=dcim.site" \
-F "object_id=2" \
-F "name=attachment1.png" \
-F "image=@local_file.png" \
http://netbox/api/extras/image-attachments/
```

## Authentication

The NetBox REST API primarily employs token-based authentication. For convenience, cookie-based authentication can also be used when navigating the browsable API.

### Tokens

A token is a secret, unique identifier mapped to a NetBox user account. Each user may have one or more tokens which he or she can use for authentication when making REST API requests. To create a token, navigate to the API tokens page under your user profile. When creating a token, NetBox will automatically generate a random token value. This value is always generated by the server and cannot be specified by the client; any `token` value included in a creation request is ignored.

!!! note "Tokens cannot be retrieved once created"
    Once a token has been created, its plaintext value cannot be retrieved. For this reason, you must take care to securely record the token locally immediately upon its creation. If a token plaintext is lost, it cannot be recovered: A new token must be created.

By default, all users can create and manage their own REST API tokens under the user control panel in the UI or via the REST API. This ability can be disabled by overriding the [`DEFAULT_PERMISSIONS`](../configuration/security.md#default_permissions) configuration parameter.

Additionally, a token can be set to expire at a specific time. This can be useful if an external client needs to be granted temporary access to NetBox.

#### v1 and v2 Tokens

!!! warning "v1 Tokens Are Deprecated"
    v1 API tokens are deprecated as of NetBox v4.6 and will be removed in NetBox v5.0. All users should migrate to v2 tokens.

Beginning with NetBox v4.5, two versions of API token are supported, denoted as v1 and v2. Users are strongly encouraged to create only v2 tokens and to discontinue the use of v1 tokens.

v2 API tokens offer much stronger security. The token plaintext given at creation time is hashed together with a configured [cryptographic pepper](../configuration/required-parameters.md#api_token_peppers) to generate a unique checksum. This checksum is irreversible; the token plaintext is never stored on the server and thus cannot be retrieved even with database-level access.

#### Restricting Write Operations

By default, a token can be used to perform all actions via the API that a user would be permitted to do via the web UI. Deselecting the "write enabled" option will restrict API requests made with the token to read operations (e.g. GET) only.

#### Client IP Restriction

Each API token can optionally be restricted by client IP address. If one or more allowed IP prefixes/addresses is defined for a token, authentication will fail for any client connecting from an IP address outside the defined range(s). This enables restricting the use a token to a specific client. (By default, any client IP address is permitted.)

The client IP address is determined from the HTTP headers configured by [`HTTP_CLIENT_IP_HEADERS`](../configuration/system.md#http_client_ip_headers); see the security note there regarding header trust.

#### Creating Tokens for Other Users

It is possible to provision authentication tokens for other users via the REST API. To do, so the requesting user must have the `users.grant_token` permission assigned. While all users have inherent permission by default to create their own tokens, this permission is required to enable the creation of tokens for other users.

!!! warning "Exercise Caution"
    The ability to create tokens on behalf of other users enables the requestor to access the created token. This ability is intended e.g. for the provisioning of tokens by automated services, and should be used with extreme caution to avoid a security compromise.

### Authenticating to the API

An authentication token is included with a request in its `Authorization` header. The format of the header value depends on the version of token in use. v2 tokens use the following form, concatenating the token's prefix (`nbt_`) and key with its plaintext value, separated by a period:

```
Authorization: Bearer nbt_<key>.<token>
```

Legacy v1 tokens use the prefix `Token` rather than `Bearer`, and include only the token plaintext. (v1 tokens do not have a key.)

```
Authorization: Token <token>
```

Below is an example REST API request utilizing a v2 token.

```
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer nbt_4F9DAouzURLb.zjebxBPzICiPbWz0Wtx0fTL7bCKXKGTYhNzkgC2S" \
-H "Accept: application/json; indent=4" \
https://netbox/api/dcim/sites/
{
    "count": 10,
    "next": null,
    "previous": null,
    "results": [...]
}
```

A token is not required for read-only operations which have been exempted from permissions enforcement (using the [`EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS`](../configuration/security.md#exempt_view_permissions) configuration parameter). However, if a token _is_ required but not present in a request, the API will return a 403 (Forbidden) response:

```
$ curl https://netbox/api/dcim/sites/
{
    "detail": "Authentication credentials were not provided."
}
```

When a token is used to authenticate a request, its `last_updated` time updated to the current time if its last use was recorded more than 60 seconds ago (or was never recorded). This allows users to determine which tokens have been active recently.

!!! note
    The "last used" time for tokens will not be updated while maintenance mode is enabled.

### Initial Token Provisioning

Ideally, each user should provision his or her own API token(s) via the web UI. However, you may encounter a scenario where a token must be created by a user via the REST API itself. NetBox provides a special endpoint to provision tokens using a valid username and password combination. (Note that the user must have permission to create API tokens regardless of the interface used.)

To provision a token via the REST API, make a `POST` request to the `/api/users/tokens/provision/` endpoint:

```
$ curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json; indent=4" \
https://netbox/api/users/tokens/provision/ \
--data '{
    "username": "hankhill",
    "password": "I<3C3H8"
}'
```

Note that we are _not_ passing an existing REST API token with this request. If the supplied credentials are valid, a new REST API token will be automatically created for the user. Note that the key will be automatically generated, and write ability will be enabled.

```json
{
    "id": 6,
    "url": "https://netbox/api/users/tokens/6/",
    "display_url": "https://netbox/api/users/tokens/6/",
    "display": "**********************************3c9cb9",
    "user": {
        "id": 2,
        "url": "https://netbox/api/users/users/2/",
        "display": "hankhill",
        "username": "hankhill"
    },
    "created": "2024-03-11T20:09:13.339367Z",
    "expires": null,
    "last_used": null,
    "key": "9fc9b897abec9ada2da6aec9dbc34596293c9cb9",
    "write_enabled": true,
    "description": "",
    "allowed_ips": []
}
```

## HTTP Headers

### `API-Version`

This header specifies the API version in use. This will always match the version of NetBox installed. For example, NetBox v3.4.2 will report an API version of `3.4`.

### `X-Request-ID`

This header specifies the unique ID assigned to the received API request. It can be very handy for correlating a request with change records. For example, after creating several new objects, you can filter against the object changes API endpoint to retrieve the resulting change records:

```
GET /api/extras/object-changes/?request_id=e39c84bc-f169-4d5f-bc1c-94487a1b18b5
```

The request ID can also be used to filter many objects directly, to return those created or updated by a certain request:

```
GET /api/dcim/sites/?created_by_request=e39c84bc-f169-4d5f-bc1c-94487a1b18b5
```

!!! note
    This header is included with _all_ NetBox responses, although it is most practical when working with an API.

### `ETag`

A weak entity tag (e.g. `W/"2026-05-01T17:42:11.123456+00:00"`) returned on detail-view responses for individual objects. The value is derived from the object's `last_updated` timestamp (or `created`, if the object has no `last_updated`). Clients may supply this value on a subsequent write request via the `If-Match` header to perform a conditional update. See [Concurrent Update Protection](#concurrent-update-protection) for details.

### `If-Match`

A request header which may be supplied on `PATCH` or `PUT` requests targeting a single object. If the object's current ETag does not match any value supplied, the request is rejected with a `412 Precondition Failed` response. A literal value of `*` matches any existing object. See [Concurrent Update Protection](#concurrent-update-protection) for details.

### `Idempotency-Key`

A request header which may be supplied on write requests (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) to make retries safe. The first request with a given key (within the scope of the authenticated user, HTTP method, and request path) executes normally, and subsequent identical requests replay its stored response rather than performing the write again. See [Idempotent Writes](#idempotent-writes).

### `Idempotency-Replayed`

A response header with value `true` indicating that the response was replayed from a previously completed request with the same `Idempotency-Key`, rather than being executed. The absence of this header means the request was executed normally.
